# MIT face recognition project dataset
In this project, the dataset from “MIT face recognition project” (http://courses.media.mit.edu/2004fall/mas622j/04.projects/faces/) was used for classifying face images using different machine learning algorithms including. The dataset contains face images from different age, race and sex groups makes the classification task more challenging. Also, cumulatively, there are about 400 infant, face aside, too dark, too bright, and blank images in the dataset. Therefore, these images should either be preprocessed or excluded before the classification analysis. 

# Dimentionality reduction
We used PCA to effectively reduce the dimention of 
FaceRecognition_PCA
