# Dataset
This repository, contains two different datasets. 1) The “MIT face recognition project” (http://courses.media.mit.edu/2004fall/mas622j/04.projects/faces/) dataset, 2) my hand-picked celebrities images.

# General eigenface procedure
We randomly selected 40 children face images from the dataset and shown them in the following figure. Next, we used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimentionality reduction, and summarizing the correlations among a set of observed variables with a smaller set of linear combinations. In order to capture the variance in the set of variables for face recognition, we computed the covariance matrix of the data containing vectorized images in each column (Γ1, ..., Γ2).

Since all faces are natural human faces, they all have common features such as eyes, nose, mouth, etc. that appeare in the average face (Ψ). The average face is shown in the following figure. Then the average face vector is subtracted from each image in the data (Φ = φ1, ..., φn, φi = Γ − Ψ).

The covariance matrix of data (Φ), then, is computed by (1/M ∑mi=1 φit(φi)) . C which is an n×n matrix. The PCA (SVD) is applied on this covariance matrix C([U, S, V ] = SV D(C)). The columns of V matrix are bases of eigenspace. The top eight dominant eigenvectors (eigenfaces) of are shown in the following figure.

# Computation reduction

Since each vectorized image is 16384 × 1 pixels, the covariance matrix of data is n × n as well. Thus, computing even first 20 dominant eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the C is time consuming. Thus, instead we use the formulation shown in the following figure to significantly expedite the computation time of the algorithm. This formulation reduces computation of eigenvectors/eigenvalues from computing 16384 × 16384 covariance matrix to computing eigenvectors/eigenvalues of 16 × 16 covariance matrix where 16 is the number of images in the dataset (m). Therefore, we used the lower dimention (16 × 16) covariance matrix to obtain the following results. In addition to dimentionality reduction formulation, in the following figure, the pattern of the covariance matrix, the singular value matrix, and the eigenfaces matrix are shown.

# Image reconstruction

We used the linear combination of eigenfaces to reconstruct the images in the dataset. Therefore, depending on the desire quality of reconstruction, we can use different rank approximations or number of eignevectors. Of course, as we use a larger number of eigenspace's basis (eigenfaces/eigenvectors) or as we use a larger rank for reconstruction, we have a lower reconstruction error. In the following figure, we showed the reconstruction results for two randomly selected faces from the dataset using 3, 7,11, and 15 eigenvectors, and we sould how the reconstruction error decreases as the number of eignenvectors increase.

# Face recognition

We used KNN (K-nearest neighbors) for the face recognition. We first projected all images into the eigenspace and then we computed the Euclidean distance between the projection of the image in the testset with the projection of all images in the training set. The image with a smallest distance then will be recognized as the most similar face to the test image. In the folowing image, we showed the KNN results (with K=1) for face recognition.

# Face recognition: repetitive images from same subject

So far, all results are based on the centered covariance matrix of the data. In this section, we used another approach for face recognition that does not require centering the train/test images by subtracting the average face from them. We provided a handpicked dataset from six celebrities that contains six different face images per subject.  In the following figure, six images per subject as well as their average face is shown.

Since the average face containing common facial features such as eyes, nose and etc. are not subtracted from the images, then the first eigenmode (most dominant eigenmode) using PCA correspondes to the average face. In the following figure, we showed 8 dominant eigenfaces (eigenvectors) and the eignemodes (eigenvalues) as well as the average face. It is clear that first eigenvector associated with most dominant eigenmode is same as the average face.

The projection of each subject’s average face into the eigenspace results in an unique pattern for every subject. Since every subject has a very different projection into the eigenspace, these patterns can be considered as features for classification or for face recognition. The following figure indicates these unique patterns per subject.

Next, we used these unique patterns to find the closest match image in the train set for a given test image. We first projected the average face of the test image into the eigenspace and extracted the projection pattern in the eigenspace for the test image. Then, we reconstructed each test image and compared each reconstruction error with each train images. As indicated in the following figure, the reconstruction of the toppest test image is exact since this image exist in the train set. Therefore, the algorithm could with 100% accuracy recognize the test image as the number 3 in the training set images shown on the right of the following image. As indicated, based on the bar charts, the second test image is has the smallest error from the second training face image and the third and the fourth test images have the smallest error from the third image in the training set.

# Who Do I look like the most in my hand picked celebrities data set?

Finally, I was curious to know who do I look like the most among my hand-picked celebrities dataset. I found that among Angela Merkel, Barack Obama, christopher Nolan, Lionel Messi, Emma Watson, and Whitney Houston, my image's reconstruction has the least error (0.37) with one of the Lionel Messi's image :>. In the following figure, I showed the error between my image's reconstruction and the aformentioned celebrities dataset.
